##Introduction
It is required the development of a device that allows the capture of the electromagnetic field (EMF) from the  high voltage lines in the VII region of Maule, Chile.
The information obtained must be suitable for recording in sound format and at the same time, stored in a microSD (TF) card in ADC 10bits resolution format for the 
subsequent activation of a microcontrolled water pump.
